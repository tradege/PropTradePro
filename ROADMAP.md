|-------|----------|------------|
| Phase 1 (Done) | âœ… Completed | 50% |
| Phase 2 | 1-2 weeks | 65% |
| Phase 3 | 3-4 weeks | 85% |

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Path (Minimum Viable Product)

If you want to launch faster with core features only:

### MVP Includes:
1. âœ… Authentication (Done)
2. âœ… Database models (Done)
3. âœ… API routes (Done)
4. ðŸš§ Stripe payments (Phase 2)
5. ðŸš§ Basic Frontend (Phase 3 - simplified)
6. ðŸš§ MetaTrader integration (Phase 4)

**MVP Timeline: 6-8 weeks**

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendation

**Option A: Full System (like FXIFY)**
- Complete all 7 phases
- Timeline: 3-4 months
- Result: Professional, scalable, feature-rich platform

**Option B: MVP First, Then Iterate**
- Focus on Phases 2, 3 (basic), 4 (basic)
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks
- Launch with core features
- Add advanced features after launch

**I recommend Option B** - Get to market faster, validate with users, then add features based on real feedback.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

**Ready to continue?** I can work on:
1. **Phase 2** - Stripe + Email integration
2. **Phase 3** - Start building the Frontend
3. **Something specific you need first**

What would you like me to focus on next?
