**Services Restarted:**

## ⚠️ Current Issue

**Problem:** The old Profile page is still being displayed instead of the new enhanced version.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. ✅ Correct file exists in server: `/root/PropTradePro/frontend/src/pages/user/Profile_mui.jsx`
2. ✅ File contains new code (verified with grep "Profile Settings")
3. ✅ Build completed successfully (27.89s)
4. ❌ Browser still shows old "My Profile" page instead of new "Profile Settings" page

**Possible Causes:**
- Browser cache (tried hard refresh, didn't work)
- Service worker cache
- CDN cache (if using)
- Build output not being served correctly

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Debug Current Implementation
1. Check if there's a service worker caching the old version
2. Verify nginx/server configuration is serving latest dist files
3. Check browser DevTools Network tab for actual file being loaded

### Option 2: Alternative Approach
1. Create a completely new route (e.g., `/profile-new`)
2. Test if new code works on new route
3. Then replace old route

### Option 3: Manual Testing
1. Ask user to test on their browser (not my sandbox browser)
2. User's browser won't have cache issues

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Avatar Upload Flow:
```
1. User selects file
2. Frontend validates file (size, type)
3. FormData created with file
4. POST /api/v1/profile/avatar
5. Backend saves to DigitalOcean Spaces
6. Presigned URL returned
7. User object updated with avatar_url
8. UI refreshes with new avatar
```

### Storage Structure:
```
marketedgepros-storage/
└── avatars/
    └── {user_id}/
        └── avatar_{timestamp}.{ext}
```

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**I recommend asking the user to test the profile page on their own browser** to verify if the issue is just with my sandbox browser cache, or if there's a real deployment issue.

If the user also sees the old page, we need to investigate the server configuration or build process further.

**Next Action:** Wait for user feedback or proceed with debugging steps.
