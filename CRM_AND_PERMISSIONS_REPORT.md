    # Lead Status
    status: new, contacted, qualified, negotiating, converted, lost
    
    # Source Tracking
    source: website, referral, agent, social_media, paid_ads, organic
    
    # Scoring
    score: 0-100 (calculated automatically)
    
    # Assignment

### Lead Scoring Algorithm:

```python
def calculate_score():
    score = 0
    
    if email: score += 10
    if phone: score += 10
    if budget > 0: score += 20
    if interested_program: score += 15
    if contacted: score += 10
    if recent_activity (< 7 days): score += 20
    if recent_activity (< 30 days): score += 10
    if company: score += 5
    if status == 'qualified': score += 10
    
    return min(score, 100)
```

**Score Ranges:**
- 80-100: Hot lead 🔥
- 60-79: Warm lead ⚡
- 40-59: Cold lead ❄️
- 0-39: Very cold lead 🧊
