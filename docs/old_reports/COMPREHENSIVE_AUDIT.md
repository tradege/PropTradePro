## üé® UX/UI Design Audit

### 1.1 Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

#### Checklist:
- [x] HTML Semantic Tags
- [x] ARIA Labels
- [ ] Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Color Contrast Ratio
- [x] Focus Indicators
- [ ] Alt Text for Images

#### Findings:

- **Critical Issues:**
  - `<h1>` tags contained `<span>` elements without ARIA labels, making them less accessible to screen readers.
  - Call-to-action buttons lacked `aria-label` attributes, providing insufficient context for assistive technologies.
  - Statistics sections were not wrapped in semantic HTML like `<section>` or `<article>`, reducing their structural meaning.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Add `aria-label` to all interactive elements.
  - Use semantic HTML to structure content logically.

## üîç SEO Optimization Audit

### 2.1 Meta Tags & Structured Data

#### Checklist:
- [x] Title Tag
- [x] Meta Description
- [x] Meta Keywords
- [x] Open Graph Tags
- [x] Twitter Cards
- [x] Structured Data (Schema.org)
- [x] Canonical URL

#### Findings:

- **Critical Issues:**
  - The `index.html` file had a generic `<title>` (`frontend`) and was missing all essential meta tags, Open Graph tags, and structured data.

- **Fixes Implemented:**
  - Rewrote `index.html` to include comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph tags, Twitter Cards, and Schema.org structured data.

### 2.2 Crawlability & Indexing

#### Checklist:
- [x] robots.txt
- [x] sitemap.xml

#### Findings:

- **Critical Issues:**
  - `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` were missing, hindering search engine crawling and indexing.

- **Fixes Implemented:**
  - Created a `robots.txt` file to guide search engine bots.
  - Generated a `sitemap.xml` to list all crawlable pages.

## ‚ö° Performance Audit

### 3.1 Bundle Size & Code Splitting

#### Checklist:
- [x] Bundle Size Analysis
- [x] Code Splitting (Lazy Loading)
- [x] Tree Shaking
- [x] Minification

#### Findings:

- **Critical Issues:**
  - The initial JavaScript bundle size was **897KB**, significantly impacting loading times.
  - No code splitting was implemented, forcing users to download the entire application at once.

- **Fixes Implemented:**
  - Implemented lazy loading for all routes in `App.jsx`, reducing the initial bundle size to **330KB** (a 63% reduction).
  - Configured `vite.config.js` for optimal chunk splitting and minification, including removing `console.log` statements in production.

- [x] Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

#### Findings:

- **Critical Issues:**
  - The backend was not sending any security headers, leaving the application vulnerable to common web attacks.

- **Fixes Implemented:**
  - Added a middleware in `app.py` to include all essential security headers in every response.
